On Froala Editor's website, they only have server side integration examples in PHP and ASP.NET
And there're not so much information on server integration in Python with Flask on the Internet.


All images uploaded through Froala are stored on their server by default and could be removed anytime.
In this example, I reset the image upload path to the static folder.
